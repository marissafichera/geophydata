                "abstract": "The New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources will map in the Cornudas Mountains in Trans-Pecos Tertiary alkaline magmatic province of southern New Mexico. The Cornudas Mountains are located in southern Otero County, New Mexico and northern Huspeth County, Texas. The igneous rocks in the Cornudas Mountains were emplaced at or during the beginning of Rio Grande rift extension (~33-36 Ma) and consist of ten larger sills, plugs, and laccoliths and smaller dikes and plugs, which intrude relatively flat-lying limestones and other sedimentary rocks of the Permian Hueco Limestone and Bone Spring Limestone. Compositionally, the igneous rocks in the Cornudas Mountains are classified as alkaline, ferroan, metaluminous to peralkaline and plot as A-type, within-plate granites. The alkaline igneous rocks exhibit typical light-REE-enriched chondrite-normalized patterns. The mapping will help define the geologic framework for areas with potential economic deposits of REE-Zr-Nb (\u00b1U, Be) epithermal veins and breccia deposits. In addition, the area has potential of several other types of mineral deposits, including nepheline syenite for ceramics and sand blasting, and Au, Ag, Be, Nb, and U veins. One goal of the effort is to better characterize the igneous system and associated mineralization and alteration regionally in order to assess the economic potential throughout the Cornudas Mountains. This is a coordinated project being conducted in concert with the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology, which is mapping the Cornudas Mountain in Texas, and the USGS Mineral Resources Program, which is acquiring a new airborne magnetic and radiometric survey of the region, all of which are supported by Earth MRI.",
