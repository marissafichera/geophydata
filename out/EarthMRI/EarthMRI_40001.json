                "abstract": "There are tens of thousands of inactive or abandoned mine features in 274 mining districts in New Mexico (NM), including coal, uranium, metals, and industrial minerals districts. Many of these mines have related mine waste materials, which could have potential for containing critical minerals, because the actual mineral production was generally for precious and base metals and not critical minerals. Therefore, any critical minerals that occur naturally in the mineral deposits would presumably be present in the mine wastes. The New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources is conducting a project to characterize and estimate the critical mineral endowment of mine wastes in three mining districts in NM: (1) Copper Flat at Hillsboro, (2) Black Hawk in Burro Mountains, and (3) Carlisle-Center mines in Steeple Rock district. The Copper Flat mine is an example of a porphyry copper deposit, among other related deposit types. Known critical minerals in the district include Te, As, Bi, Mg, Mn, and Zn. The Black Hawk district (also known as Bullard's Peak) is an example of the arsenide mineral system and contains five-element veins among other deposit types. Known critical minerals in the district include Co, Ni, As, REE, Bi, W, Te, fluorite, and Zn. The Carlisle-Center mines are examples of a low sulfidation, volcanic-epithermal system and contain Au-Ag veins among other deposit types. Known critical minerals in the district include As, Bi, Te, fluorite, and Zn. Detailed maps will be produced, showing the geology and extent of mine wastes in the project areas within the three mining districts sampled and characterized. Approximately 100 composite mine waste samples (from mine dumps, low grade stockpiles, tailings from all three sites) will be collected for geochemical analysis in order to calculate the total critical mineral potential in these wastes. Samples will be selected for additional mineralogical, microbial, and leaching studies based upon the chemical analyses. Approximately 15 water samples for pH, major cation and anion and trace elements will be obtained from all three sites to determine if there are any critical minerals potential in the mine waters. Potential critical minerals in the project area: As, Bi, Fluorite, Mg, Mn, REE, Te, W, and Zn.",
