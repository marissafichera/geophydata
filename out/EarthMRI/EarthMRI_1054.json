The unique igneous rocks that make up this belt have high concentrations of rare earth elements (REE), fluorine, zirconium, tellurium, gallium, other critical minerals, gold, and uranium. \nThe southern New Mexico Alkaline Igneous Belt aeromagnetic/aeroradiometric survey will cover over 15,150 square kilometers (over 5,800 square miles) within the NACAIB in southern New Mexico. This airborne survey will include over 45,200 flightline kilometers (over 28,000 flightline miles) of passively acquired Earth\u2019s magnetic field and radiometric data with a flightline spacing of 200 meters draped at approximately 120 meters above the ground. The survey will border the existing Trans-Pecos aeromagnetic/aeroradiometric survey to the south and includes several important known critical and other mineral occurrences including the Gallinas Mountains REE (carbonatite), Capitan Mountains REE, White Oaks (gold), Jicarilla (gold), and more. In addition, the survey area lies within the Basin and Range geologic province providing concealed terrane that is virtually unexplored. The current geophysical data in the region is inadequate and these new data will add tremendously to our geologic knowledge, help understand existing mineral occurrences and deposits, and possibly help define unknown mineral occurrences.",
