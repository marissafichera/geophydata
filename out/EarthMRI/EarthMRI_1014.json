The survey was funded by the USGS Earth Mapping Resource Initiative and will be coordinated with both the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology and the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. The effort is focused on an area of Tertiary alkaline intrusive rocks that are known to have high REE concentrations and which are exemplified by the Round Top REE deposit, Hudspeth County, Texas. The survey includes 34,483-line km of magnetic and radiometric data collected from both a helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft covering 2,419 square miles.  Flight lines were spaced at 200 m and draped at 125 m altitude. The mineral systems of interest in the survey area are: REE in highly fractionated rhyolites, REE-Th-U veins, REE-F veins, Cu-REE-F veins, REE-F breccia pipes, Fe skarns, Porphyry Mo, and a potential for Carbonatites. The potential critical mineral commodities investigated include: REE, W, U, Nb, Be, F, Rb, Hf, Ta, Sn, Li, and Zr, with additional prospectively for non-critical Mo, Cu, Fe, and Th. Much of the survey area is composed of Cretaceous sedimentary rock or Quaternary basin fill and the survey is designed to reveal concealed Tertiary intrusive rocks that are associated with mineral deposits.",
