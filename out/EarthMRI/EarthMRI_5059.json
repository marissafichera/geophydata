                "abstract": "The Black Hawk arsenide-5-element vein deposits are an unusual high-grade, hydrothermal vein deposit type that contains silver (Ag) and various critical minerals including nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), bismuth (Bi), arsenic (As) and local uranium (U), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and antimony (Sb). The arsenide-5-element vein deposits in the Black Hawk district are the only such deposits known in New Mexico and have been known since they were first mined for Ag in the late 1880s. The Black Hawk district in the Burro Mountains, in southwestern New Mexico, occurs within a Proterozoic highland that has been affected by Laramide compression and magmatic intrusions followed by caldera magmatism and later during extension associated with the development of the Rio Grande rift. The Black Hawk deposits are ankerite-bearing, northeast-trending fissure veins hosted within Proterozoic metamorphic and granitic rocks. The vein deposits are thought to be Late Cretaceous in age, and possibly related to the porphyry copper deposits, based upon field relationships and a K-Ar age of 65.3\u00b11.2 Ma on alteration assemblages at the Black Hawk mine. The purposes of this project are to (1) map the geology, structure, alteration, and mineralized areas, (2) determine the mineralogy, chemical composition, origin, and critical-mineral potential of the arsenide-5-element vein deposits in the Black Hawk district, and (3) compare the Black Hawk deposits to other arsenide-5-element vein deposits in the world. Highly altered areas could be indicative of higher grades of undiscovered mineral resources and used as vectors towards highly mineralized zones. Geochemical whole rock and mineral analyses of igneous rocks, mineralized veins, and alteration zones will aid in a better understanding of the genetic relationship between the igneous intrusions and the mineralization processes in the area. Potential critical minerals in the project area: As, Bi, Co, Sb, and Zn.",
