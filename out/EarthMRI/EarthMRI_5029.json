The area lies within the Trans-Pecos Tertiary alkaline magmatic province that extends northward into New Mexico. The Paleogene alkaline igneous rocks in Trans-Pecos Texas have the potential to host critical mineral resources including rare earth elements (REE), such as those of the Round Top REE deposit. This is a companion project being conducted in concert with the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, which is mapping the Cornudas Mountain in New Mexico, and the USGS Mineral Resources Program to conduct an airborne magnetic and radiometric survey of the region, all of which are supported by Earth MRI.",
